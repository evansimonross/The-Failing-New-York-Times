## Project History
This project was made by [Evan Simon Ross](https://evansimonross.github.io/) as a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp to practice MongoDB. The original assignment was to make a news scraping app with comments, and I gave myself the additional challenge to add votes. The idea to only allow negative votes hit me, and that's how I came up with the unfortunate theme!
